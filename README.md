# BCG-Data-for-Decision-Makers-Job-Simulation-on-Forage-

## Overview
This repo contains my deliverables for the BCG X analytics simulation. The goal was to answer:
Which campaign + channel combination should the client double down on to grow new-customer sales, and why?**

I used Excel PivotTables and a slicer to isolate new customers*, then created a simple chart and slide that highlights the top-performing combinations.







Tools: Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint
