# BCG-Data Analytics Simulation

## Overview
This repo contains my deliverables for an BCG X analytics Project through Forage. The goal was to identify which campaign and channel combination to prioritize to increase new customer sales, and explain why.

Approach
I analyzed the dataset in Excel using PivotTables and filters to isolate new customers. I summarized performance by campaign and channel, then created a simple chart and a short slide to communicate the top-performing combinations and the recommendation.

Tools
Excel (PivotTables, slicers), Microsoft PowerPoint





Tools: Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint
